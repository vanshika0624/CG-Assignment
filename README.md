TOLL COLLECTING GATE

The main idea behind this project is to display the concept of a toll collecting booth
with computer graphics.
This project will include a toll collecting booth where as soon as the
car approaches the toll booth, the barrier is imposed. This barrier will then be lifted
by the user. This project has a two- way path with cars travelling in both directions
and collecting booths for both directions.The user can see the cars travelling on the
road. To open the left side barrier we use to press ‘L|l’ key, as soon as the key is
pressed the left side car will move. And in the same way, we have ‘R|r’ key to open
the barrier and allow the car to move further. Here we can also increase or decrease
the speed of the cars by using appropriate keys.
